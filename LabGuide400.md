## Introduction

Welcome to an introduction of rsync. Rsync is a file copying tool that exists on most linux environments. It is capable of copying files locally and to/from another host over a remote shell. Its differentiating feat is its delta-transfer algorithm that focuses on syncing the changes observed in files. This optimizes the sync by reducing the amount of data sent over the network. Rsync is used extensively in backups, disaster recovery, and mirroring scenarios. 

For this lab specifically, we will be working in the terminal exclusively. As a result, we've included the commands to run as we walk you through the lab steps. 

In the first part of this lab, we will sync files locally on our machines to get an introductory grasp of rsync. 

In the second and final part of the lab, we will simulate how an administrator would sync files between a local machine and a remote server.

*This lab will leverage the existing infrastructure that was created previously from the terraform script.* 

### Objectives
- Understand the syntax of rsync.
- Sync files locally.
- Sync files between a local host and a remote server.

### Extra Resources
-   To learn more about rsync, please refer to the following Linux documentation: [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync)
-   To learn more about specific rsync use cases, please refer to the following tutorial [rsync usage](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-rsync-to-sync-local-and-remote-directories-on-a-vps).

## Part 1. Syncing files between two folders on the same local machine.

### **Step 1:** Create two folders. Name one "primary_sync" and the other "standby_sync".

```Shell
<local_machine>$ mkdir primary_sync standby_sync

<local_machine>$ ls 
```

### **Step 2:** Create a file in "primary_sync" and name it "primary.txt".

```
<local_machine>$ touch primary_sync/primary.txt

<local_machine>$ ls primary_sync 
```

### **Step 3:** Verify that only "primary_sync" has a file in it and "standby_sync" is empty.

```
<local_machine>$ ls primary_sync/ standby_sync/
```

### Before we use rsync to sync the file between the folders, a little about the option flags we'll be using:
#### "-a" represents "archive". It allows us to sync all files in the source directory recursively while preserving any symbolic links, special and device files, modification times, group, owner, and permission.
#### "-v" represents "verbose". This flag lets us know what's happening when the command is run.
#### "-P" represents the combination of the "progress" and "partial" flags which allow us to see the transfer progress bar as well as the resumption of interrupted transfers.
#### "-n" represented "dry-run". This flag shows what content would have been transferred, useful to test out connectivity to the target host as well as target folder access. 

### **Step 4:** Great, now let's execute our first sync between the two folders. Let's include the "-n" flag first to make sure everything is in place before we actually sync the file.

```
<local_machine>$ rsync -avP primary_sync/ standby_sync -n

<local_machine>$ ls primary_sync/ standby_sync/
```

### **Step 5:** Removing the "-n" flag will sync the file over to the "standby_sync" folder.
```
<local_machine>$ rsync -avP primary_sync/ standby_sync 
 
<local_machine>$ ls primary_sync/ standby_sync/
```
### Nice work! You've successfully used rsync to sync a file between two local folders.

## Part 2. Syncing files between a local host and a remote server.

### **Step 1:** Add the public key to your bastion server to your machine's key chain (authentication agent).
```
<local_machine>$ ssh-add -k ~/<bastion_server_public_key>
```

### **Step 2:** Next SSH into the remote server. There are two new flags to consider:
#### "-A" enables us to forward our connection from an authentication agent. We populated this in the previous step.
#### "-J" allows us to connect to the target machine (application server) after connecting to the "jump host" (bastion server).
```
<local_machine>$ ssh -A -J opc@<bastion_public_ip> opc@<app_server_private_ip>
```

### **Step 3:** Now let's begin syncing files from our local machine to the remote server. Leave the terminal window that's connected to the remote server open and open a new terminal window. In the terminal that's connected to your local machine, create an application file folder and name it "app_files".
```
<local_machine>$ mkdir app_files

<local_machine>$ ls
```

### **Step 4:** Next, create an empty file in the application file folder and name it "app_file_1".
```
<local_machine>$ touch app_files/app_file_1

<local_machine>$ ls app_files
```

### **Step 5:** Now navigate back to the terminal window connected to the remote server. Verify that "app_files/app_file_1" does not exist on the server.
```
opc@<remote_server>$ ls 
```
### **Step 6:** We will now do a dry-run sync of the folder and its file from our local machine to the remote server. The syntax will differ a bit from Part 1 as we are leveraging a new option flag:
#### "-e" allows us to execute shell commands. We'll leverage this to hop into the remote server from the bastion server.
```
<local_machine>$ rsync -avP "ssh -A -J opc@<bastion_public_ip>" app_files opc@<app_server_private_ip>:/home/opc/ -n
```
### **Step 7:** After testing the sync with the "-n" flag, remove it and re-run the command. You should now see that the "app_files" folder and its contents are synced to the remote server. Navigate to the remote server terminal and verify.
```
opc@<remote_server>$ ls
```

### Congratulations, you successfully simulated the synchronization of files between a local machine and a remote server!

## Summary

-   In this lab, you learned how to use rsync to sync files on a local machine as well as from a local machine to a remote server.

-   **You are ready to move on to the next lab!**
