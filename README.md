## Introduction

In this workshop, we'll take an in-depth look into the disaster recovery (DR) solutions that are leveraged by Oracle's customers. These solutions will cover the discussion around disaster recovery at both the application and database levels.

### Objectives
- Leverage Rsync to sync application files between the primary and DR servers
- Set up DR failover using Oracle Data Guard through the OCI console as well as through manual configurations.
- Simulate DR for solution verification.
